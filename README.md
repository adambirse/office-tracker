# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a sample project written to support [a two-part series](https://bionic.fullstory.com/building-apis-with-the-aws-cdk-lerna-webpack-part-1/) on the FullStory Bionic blog.

Read the articles to learn how to deploy a basic serverless API with the AWS CDK, organize your code with Lerna, and optimize with Webpack.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
